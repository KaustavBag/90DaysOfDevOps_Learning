Doubts: 1. Why mkdir day{1..10} command works but it does not works in shell scripts

2. Container vs VM in depth and newtorking in container vs VM

3. What does ubuntu base image contains if container does not have kernel ?

Answer--> 2. VM has complete isolation and control as it has full OS where containers uses host kernel to share resources, it has only minimal set of configurations to run an application with application code and it's dependencies.

3. A base image contains application code and it's runtime with mandatory binaries and utilities to boot an OS.


--------------------

1. Started learning gitlab CI
2. Today resume AV DevOps Z to H and, learn about maven lifecycle

Deploy a nginx server using kind and helm chart-->

# Learned about docker image lifecycle--> dockerfile--> build-->image -->run-->container-->push

#Created gitlab-cit.yml to create the CI pipeline

# Today will be creating the pipeline and dcoker project from AV ZtoH

#Hem is a package manager for K8S, minikube is the latest one

#in VM virtualization happens at hardware level with the help of Hypervisor where in Containers virtulization happens at OS level with the help of containerization engine.

# In Containers it's isolation of process where in VM it's isolation of machine.
