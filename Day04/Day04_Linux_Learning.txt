** Kernel --> It's software program which is responsible for managing, controlling or handleing system processes, user processes, system calls , devices etc. It's the most important part of OS and called 'heart' of an OS. Thr kernel of Linux distro is called 'Linux'. 

** Shell--> Shell is a computer program, specifically a command line interpreter which accepts commands through input devices, executes the command and converts it to a language which kernel can unsderstand. Through shell we can directly talk to the kernel. 

** Shell scripting --> Executing linux commands one by one written in a file is called shell scripting. It has an extension of .sh.

** We can use vim, vi,nano etc editors to write the script.

** We can write a variable in shell script and pribt with $variable_name

** We can take user input as an command line argument with 'read' statement, e.g. read input

** We can use if - else condition in shell scripting also. e.g -->

a=10;

if [ $a > 20 ]
then
 echo "$a is greater than 20"
else 
 echo "Not grater"
fi

** We can take arguments from command line and execute scripts with the arguments. e.g. -->

Script--> echo "$1 World"


./test.sh Hello

It'll execute Hello World
